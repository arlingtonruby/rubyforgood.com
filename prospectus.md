#Sponsorship Prospectus

We're very proud to again be organizing the Ruby for Good conference. This conference, to our knowledge, is the first and currently only conference of this kind ever. We are bringing together Rubyists to learn, teach, and work on civic and open source projects.

###Why Sponsor?

By the very nature of our conference, our attendees are some of the most passionate, connected, and involved in the Ruby community. For companies looking to hire this is an excellent opportunity to meet and interact professionally and socially with prospective candidates. By sponsoring you are showing your commitment to your community, open source, and the Ruby community. Last year the conference met our attendance limit of 72 attendees, this year we are working with the host university to bump the attendance level to 100 due to the overwhelming interest.

**Note: The title of the Cotton sponsorship slot and positioning on this page is no way a reference to the importance we place on it. The name *Cotton* is meant to highlight the amazing and importance of this sponsorship level, much like the proud and majestic history of cotton itself. This amazing textile has a documented history of nearly 8000 years and its importance has been emphasized by notible historical figures like Alexander the Great, Herodotus, and King George V.**

** The website placement is to again emphasize the importance of this sponsor. We want the last thing our visitors to see is this sponsorship level so it sticks in their head.**
