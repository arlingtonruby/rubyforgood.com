### FAQ:

##### What is the Ruby for Good DC event?

The Ruby for Good DC event  is an annual event held every year since 2014,  based out of the DC-metro area where Ruby programmers from all over the globe get together over a long weekend to build technology solutions in support of nonprofits with meaningful missions that benefit our communities. In-person events consist of hanging out in communal space for a weekend with a bunch of developers and designers to build something vital to mission-driven work. Participants stay in on-site dorms; hacking and socializing takes place in communal areas. However, given travel and gathering restrictions, the 2020 event will be virtual. Join us for a gratifying weekend that is more critical now than ever before! Questions? Check out the FAQ below or send us a <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.constants.contact_email }}">note</a>.

##### What is the mission of Ruby for Good?

Several nonprofits  need the sort of technical help we can provide but are unable to afford it. We want to be the do-gooders that volunteer to solve their business/technical problems. Very little effort on our part can make a huge difference to a nonprofit. We want to help!

<!-- Inception story here -->

##### What skill-level do I need to have to attend?

All experience levels are definitely welcome! We have a wide variety of skill levels ranging from beginners, all the way up to very senior gooders, with years of experience, who work at places like Github and Salesforce. The event is as much about learning as it is about building lasting solutions. Groups are very collaborative and you’ll definitely have the opportunity to work closely with others and push a lot of code. :)

##### Do I need to be a programmer?

Developers, designers, product, and project managers, marketing and website designers are all welcome at Ruby for Good.

##### Do I need to be a Ruby programmer?

You don’t HAVE to be a Ruby programmer but it does help. We’re more than happy to welcome programmers of other languages, especially if you’re interested in learning some Ruby. :)

##### How do you choose projects?

We partner with nonprofits with missions that are vital to the communities they support and effect change in many different ways from social justice to environmental conservation, and much more. . Our Organizers Committee goes through a rigorous process of vetting potential projects and selecting them based on the scope and scale of their missions, and the viability of completion, criticality to mission success, open-source status, and impact on business functions.

##### What could be a potential project?

Potential projects are those that can be completed in about a weekend, help improve the overall efficiency of a nonprofit, and are open-source, so we can help give back to the tech community as well. Have the beginnings of an idea? <a href="https://airtable.com/shrC6VjWgka26a6eh">Suggest a project! <i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-1x"></i></a>

##### How do I suggest a project?

If you’d like to work with a specific mission or project, recommend <a href="https://airtable.com/shrC6VjWgka26a6eh">one here! <i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-1x"></i></a>

##### What ARE the projects this year?

Given the unique needs of communities created by the global pandemic in 2020, this year projects are focused around issues facing local communities and we have some great organizations lined up! We’ll announce project details, including mission-centric teams you can join, around the beginning of August, after registration closes.

##### I want to lead a team. What do I do?

During registration we’ll ask if you’d like to lead a team - say yes! We’ll be in touch in mid-to-late August with potential projects. We’ll brief you on expectations and put you in touch with your nonprofit stakeholder so you can work with them in advance of the event to set up project requirements, milestones, and plan the initial set up so you can hit the ground running with your team at the Ruby for Good event. Setup includes creating a GitHub repo under the [Ruby for Good GitHub](https://github.com/rubyforgood), filing issues, and making some technology suggestions. [You can read about the team lead process here](/team-leads).

##### How can I get more information on leading a team? I’m not certain what it entails!

In general, leading a team entails connecting with stakeholders, initial architecting, planning out project milestones, and keeping your team moving forward. Here’s more <a href="http://www.blrice.net/blog/2014/08/09/lessons-learned-at-ruby-for-good/">information</a> about leading a team from Brandon Rice, a team lead in 2015!  Still unsure and want to connect with an organizer to learn more? Send us a <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.constants.contact_email }}">note</a>.

<!-- ##### Do you allow remote teams at Ruby for Good?

Unfortunately we're unable to accomodate remote teams this time around. We'd be open to discussing that as an option in 2019 for very enterprising and motivated individuals. Drop us a <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.constants.contact_email }}">note</a>. -->

##### How can I help?

- Recommend a project: we are always looking for potential partnerships! <a href="https://airtable.com/shrC6VjWgka26a6eh">Suggest a project! <i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-1x"></i></a>
- Lead a team: a great way to up your skills, especially if you’ve been programming for a while and are eager for the experience of leading a team.
- Donations/Sponsors: we need a lot of support with fundraising! The Ruby for Good event has significant costs associated with it, and we’d like to offer economically priced tickets and low registration fees to those who attend. This is only possible with donations and sponsors! Reach out to your employers to see if they would be willing to help us give back to our community. Here’s more [information on sponsorships](/sponsors)!
- Attendees: we need developer and designer expertise, along with product and project managers!

##### Is this a hackathon?

No, this is definitely not a hackathon!  

Ruby for Good events focus on using a specific programming language to build  technology solutions toward a clearly articulated goal, working hand-in-hand with nonprofit stakeholders to solve issues and challenges that serve communities in need. 

<!-- ##### When do I need to purchase my tickets?

By August 1st or when we sell out, whichever comes first! -->

<!-- ##### Oops, I bought my ticket and now I can't go. Will you please refund/transfer?

After March 10th we will be unable to offer refunds but we will happily help coordinate exchanges until May 10th. Drop us a <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.constants.contact_email }}">note</a>. -->

<!-- ##### I’m, or want to host, an out-of-towner…

Welcome! We’d love to have any out-of-towners arrive early. If you want to be a tourist for a few days, we’ll find you somewhere to stay while you are here! If you are a local and have some extra space in your house for a Gooder to cozy up, either ping Kalimar or join the #housing channel on slack. -->

<!-- ##### Which airport should I fly into?

The best airport is probably Reagan National (closer to our venue) but if you are coming early we suggest coordinating with your host—they may live closer to a different airport. -->

<!-- ##### Where do I park?

We’re still working with the venue and will let everyone know as soon as we do. -->

<!-- ##### Can we drink alcohol?

Fermented beverages are A-okay with George Mason University—they are not a dry campus. Assuming you are of age, you are welcome to partake of fermented beverages in your dorm rooms. We do encourage moderation. -->

<!-- ##### I live in Clarendon/Foggy Bottom/nearby why do I have to stay on site?

We love helping organizations that do good, but another significant part of our mission is to grow the community and provide opportunities for Gooders to connect face-to-face—dancing, karaoke, werewolf, meditation, you name it. We want to build a strong, healthy, inclusive community and need your help to do that. AMAZING connections happen when people are around each other. Indeed, I’ve heard tell of an infamous karaoke duet partner that landed their fellow duet-singer a job by calling their manager at Ruby for Good—after midnight!—and had said duet-singer hired on the spot. Amazing things, I’m tellin’ ya. So please plan to be there, mentally and physically present, for the entirety of the event. <3 -->

<!-- ##### What fun extra stuff do you have planned?

Anyone who has attended in the past knows that we do some really fun stuff when we’re not working hard helping the nonprofits; hikes, meditation sessions, dance class, and more. We’ve volun-told Casey (begged) to teach dancing again this year and in reverting back to childhood, Aaron is planning on doing some fun adult coloring and we’ve heard that there may even be some fun Ruby for Good themed coloring books too! If you have an idea for something you’d like to do or lead, jump into the #evening-fun channel on slack! Don’t worry, we’ll still have plenty of time for karaoke, werewolf, and secret hitler! -->

##### What does my registration fee go toward?

The majority of the fee goes toward event costs. We try to raise as much as possible through sponsorships and donations but that is not always enough  to cover the cost of operations, domain purchases, server costs, and swag. The registration fee enables us to break even for the event and more importantly, provides scholarship opportunities for those that would otherwise be unable to attend.  

The event is exclusively volunteer driven and fees are not used toward the compensation of anyone involved. 

##### When do tickets go on sale?

Tickets go on sale to the public on July 13, 2020!

<!-- ##### Do I really HAVE to get there by 5pm on Thursday?

Yeah, you really do. Teams will be chosen right around that time and you'll spend dinner meeting with your team, chatting about your projects, and getting your environments aligned. We've found the event is most successful, with the most buy-in, when teams are a cohesive bunch from the beginning. -->

<!-- ##### How early can I arrive on Thursday?

Most of the organizing team is planning on arriving at 10am but feel free to beat us there! -->

<!-- ##### How does food work?

All food is provided, you just need to bring yourself! We'll even provide snacks in the evenings when we're all socializing/playing games/werewolf! -->

<!-- ##### I'm a vegetarian/dairy-free/vegan/gluten-free/paleo/allergic to... will you feed me?

Absolutely. -->

<!-- ##### What do I need to bring?

Bring yourself, your laptop, a powersource, some clothes and your favorite boardgames. Maybe some sunscreen if the weather's nice. If you anticipate skipping group meals, bring some munchies. If you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs. All the basics are provided (linens, pillows, beds, towels, etc.) We have a fun outdoor activity planned for one evening so camping chairs, a sweater and maybe some bug spray are highly recommended. -->

<!-- ##### How do I get there?

We are collecting information about carpooling [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nq7XrtqABpowMnNPPVbcRShYPwgfveUjF4TZu5CdCIU/edit).

Hop into the #carpool channel in slack for more info! -->

<!-- ##### How do I indicate I want to room with my friend/significant other?

During registration we ask if there's anything else you'd like us to know - indicate in this section who you'd like to room with and we'll make it happen. -->

<!-- ##### How do room assignments work?

Rooms contain two single beds and a bathroom. After registration closes (May 1), we will create random, same-gender room assignments (unless specifically requested otherwise via the registration form). We are tentatively planning to introduce you and your roomie via email so you know who you're staying with ahead of time. If you've neglected to indicate your roommate preference in the registration form, please drop us a <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.constants.contact_email }}">note</a>. -->

##### Do you have a code of conduct?

We are proud to have a <a href="/coc">code of conduct</a>.

##### How is 2020 different from 2019?

Due to COVID-19, the 2020 event will be virtual. We look forward to transitioning back to an in-person event as soon as it is safe to do so.

##### Do I get something special if I’ve attended all events for the last 6 years?

A big virtual bear hug from all the organizers!
