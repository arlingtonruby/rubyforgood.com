### How Does Ruby for Good Work?

The organizers of Ruby for Good work year round contacting and working with non-profits to find projects that are both within the scope of Ruby for Good and helpful to non-profit organizations and individuals. This year projects are focused around conservation and the environment.

During registration we'll ask if you'd like to lead a team. If so, we'll contact you with potential projects in mid-to-late April. We'll brief you on expectations and put you in touch with your non-profit so you can work with them in advance of the event to set up project requirements, milestones and initial setup. Setup includes creating a github repo under the Ruby for Good github, filing some issues and making some technology suggestions. For an in-depth look at what it's like to lead a team, check out Brandon Rice's [blog](http://www.blrice.net/blog/2015/08/10/leading-a-team-at-ruby-for-good/). Note: Attendees will get project details, including available teams to join, around the beginning of June.

Team assignments will take place around 5:00 pm on June 16 (which is why it's essential you're on-site by 5:00 pm). During this time team leads will get up and make a "pitch" to the attendees about their project - who they are helping, what the project is, and any specific skill sets they'd love on their team. This is an event for people of *all* skill levels so even if you are new, don't let that prevent you from contributing! Attendees self-select into projects that are meaningful to them and the fun begins!
